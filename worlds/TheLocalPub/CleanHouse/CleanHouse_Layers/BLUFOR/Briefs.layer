  "<h2>LORE</h2>"\
  "For weeks, fighting has raged across the city. Block by block, Russian Federation forces have advanced, collapsing defensive lines and isolating pockets of resistance. What began as coordinated separatist control has deteriorated into fragmented strongpoints, each fighting alone."\
  "Overnight, the final defensive belt was breached. Armored elements punched through the outer districts while mechanized infantry sealed off escape routes. Communications between separatist units have gone silent one by one."\
  "Now, only a single apartment complex remains under separatist control."\
  "The surviving fighters—what is left of a once full-strength company—have withdrawn into the building, turning it into a last stand position. They are surrounded, cut off from reinforcement, and low on supplies, but still armed and dangerous. From upper floors and shattered windows, they command sightlines over key streets and approach routes."\
  "Until this strongpoint is neutralized, the city cannot be declared secure."\
  "The encirclement is complete. The outcome now depends on how quickly and decisively the remaining resistance is dealt with."

  "Enemy forces consist of hardened separatist fighters."\
  "Estimated strength is approximately 25 personnel."\
  "They are currently dug in and making a final stand within the apartment block (GRID: 117106 )."\
  ""\
  "The apartment building is a large complex consisting of 5 floors and a rooftop. With roughly 50 meters of frontage along it's largest sides."\
  "Fortifed with dug-in fighting positions and good 360 degree sightlines."\
  ""\
  "<h2>STRENGTHS & CAPABILITIES</h2> "\
  "• The enemy is completely isolated and cut off from reinforcements and external support."\
  "• They are assessed to have limited capabilities, low morale, and dwindling supplies."\
  "• However, fighters with no avenue of escape can become highly determined and unpredictable. Expect them to exploit every available advantage, even at significant cost, and to resist fiercely despite their situation."\
  "• There is a PKM turret on the 3rd floor west facing balcony."
