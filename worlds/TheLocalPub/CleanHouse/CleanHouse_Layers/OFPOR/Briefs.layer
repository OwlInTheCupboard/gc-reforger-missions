  "<h2>LORE</h2>"\
  "For weeks, fighting has raged across the city. Block by block, Russian Federation forces have advanced, collapsing defensive lines and isolating pockets of resistance. What began as coordinated separatist control has deteriorated into fragmented strongpoints, each fighting alone."\
  "Overnight, the final defensive belt was breached. Armored elements punched through the outer districts while mechanized infantry sealed off escape routes. Communications between separatist units have gone silent one by one."\
  "Now, only a single apartment complex remains under separatist control."\
  "The surviving fighters—what is left of a once full-strength company—have withdrawn into the building, turning it into a last stand position. They are surrounded, cut off from reinforcement, and low on supplies, but still armed and dangerous. From upper floors and shattered windows, they command sightlines over key streets and approach routes."\
  "Until this strongpoint is neutralized, the city cannot be declared secure."\
  "The encirclement is complete. The outcome now depends on how quickly and decisively the remaining resistance is dealt with."

  "• They are able to establish overwatch positions, including sniper teams and support elements, in surrounding buildings and maintain sustained pressure over time, gradually degrading our defenses."\
  "• They may plan to destroy the whole building through demolitions."

  "• We maintain 360-degree coverage across five floors and a rooftop."\
  "• The building contains two internal stairwells and one external ladder, allowing access to each level and the roof. These routes provide both maneuver flexibility and fallback options during the defense."\
